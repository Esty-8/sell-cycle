##  Features
- SellCycle is a comprehensive web application developed using the Django framework, designed to provide a user-friendly platform for individuals looking to buy and sell second-hand items. This project enables users to easily add items for sale, browse available listings, and engage with other users. With an intuitive interface, sellers can efficiently manage their listings  while buyers can search, filter, and find great deals on pre-owned products. Users have the ability to **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** their listings, as well as manage their accounts seamlessly.

### Navigation Bar

 - Consistent Design: The navigation bar provides a cohesive design and layout across all pages, ensuring easy access to essential sections of the site.
 - Quick Navigation: It includes the SellCycle logo and a link to the homepage for fast navigation.
 - User Authentication: For users who are not logged in, options to register or log in are clearly displayed. Once logged in, the navigation bar updates to show the 
   Catalogue as well as add products along with a personalized greeting that includes the userâ€™s name and a profile icon.

### User Authentication (SignUp, Login, Logout)

- User authentication methods have been integrated to ensure that users can only list items for sale if they are logged in. Existing users must log in to access the selling features, while new users can easily register before making a listing request.

Dedicated login and logout pages provide a secure authentication experience. If a user attempts to log in with an incorrect username or password, immediate on-screen feedback is given, prompting them to enter the correct credentials. Additionally, a required feature ensures that users must fill in both the username and password fields, preventing incomplete submissions and enhancing overall security.

The item listing page features an eye-catching image of the product alongside a detailed description and associated pricing information. When a user wants to list an item for sale, they must provide their Name, Category , Price, and any additional required information about the item they wish to sell.
An  "Add" button is prominently displayed at the bottom of the form, allowing users to finalize their item listing.


###  CRUD Functionality for Listings

The Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality is crucial for managing user listings on SellCycle. After logging in, users have access to buttons that allow them to edit or delete their listings. They can also view their current listings at any time.

- **Edit Button**: If a user wishes to change the details of their listing, an Edit button is readily available. Upon clicking this button, users can modify the listing information, and once confirmed, the updates are applied immediately.

- **Delete Button**: Users can also easily remove their listings by clicking the Delete button. This functionality ensures that users have full control over their items and can manage their listings efficiently.

This streamlined process enhances user experience by providing intuitive options for managing listings directly from their account dashboard.

### Inbox

By categorizing productsâ€”such as women, mens, kids, can quickly hone in on their interests. Users can effortlessly explore and discover items that suit their needs.


### SellCycle: PostgreSQL Database & Super User Creation

The admin interface of SellCycle offers a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for managing data related to selling and adding items. Administrators can easily create, read, update, and delete product listings and conversations without needing direct access to the database. They can add new items across categories such as Women, Men, and Kids, complete with relevant details like price, description, and featured images. Additionally, admins can manage conversations between users, modifying or deleting them as necessary.

Non-technical users, such as business managers and customer service representatives, can navigate the Django admin interface without needing to understand the underlying code. The auto-generated forms make it straightforward to add, edit, or remove entries.

### Database Integration:

### SellCycle: Admin Functionality for Managing Listings

The admin user can add and publish items through the admin pages of SellCycle. These pages are accessible either by appending '/admin' to the application URL or by signing in and clicking the Admin link, which appears in the navigation bar only when the admin is logged in.
To add a new item, the admin can click the "+ Add" link next to the table name and then fill in the required data fields. A rich text editor (Summernote) is provided for the item description, allowing for easy formatting. If the admin user does not upload an image, a default image will be used for the item. This functionality streamlines the process of managing listings and ensures a consistent presentation on the platform.

### SellCycle: Responsive Design with Bootstrap

Responsive design ensures that SellCycle functions seamlessly across all devices, from desktops to smartphones. By leveraging Bootstrap, the website automatically adapts its layout and appearance based on screen size, providing a consistent user experience. Below are key aspects of how Bootstrap enhances responsiveness and builds user trust.

**Navbar**: The navbar-toggler feature collapses the menu on smaller screens, improving usability for mobile users. This ensures that navigation remains straightforward, regardless of device.

**Container-fluid**: This class guarantees that content adjusts fluidly to various screen widths. Bootstrapâ€™s grid system (e.g., col-md-8, offset-md-2) organizes elements effectively, maintaining proper spacing and alignment.

**Form Styling**: User experience and accessibility are prioritized with Bootstrap form controls (form-control, form-group), ensuring that all forms are consistently styled and responsive across devices.

**CSRF Token**: Security is paramount, with Djangoâ€™s CSRF protection implemented to safeguard forms from malicious attacks.

**Button Styling**: Actionable elements like "Sign in" are styled with Bootstrap's btn classes, making them easily recognizable and engaging.

**Font Awesome Icons**: The use of icons, such as user and social media icons, enhances visual interest and usability throughout the site.

**Branding**: A custom logo and favicon reinforce brand identity, contributing to a cohesive user experience.

**Content Focused on Trust**: Building trust is essential for user engagement. SellCycle fosters trust through:

- **Clear Navigation**: The navbar directs users to vital pages like "Sign in," "Sign Up," and "My Items," promoting transparency and ease of access.
- **Personalized Experience**: Displaying the logged-in userâ€™s name (e.g., Hi, {{ user.username }}) in the navbar reassures users of their secure session.
- **Social Proof**: Links to social media profiles, such as GitHub, LinkedIn, and Twitter, demonstrate the company's connections to reputable networks.
- **Secure Practices**: Implementing user authentication and form validation enhances credibility and user confidence.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

<details>
<summary>ER diagram:</summary>
<img src="static/images/diagram.png"  width="600">
</details>


### Notes on the ER diagrams :
- User: Represents the customer who adds the items. This is a foreign key referencing Django's built-in User model.
- Listing: Represents different categories available for selling an item, such as "Women", "Mens", and "Kids". Each item has attributes such as:

  - category: The type of item being sold.
  - price: The cost of the item.
  - description: Details about the item.
  - featured_image: Image associated with the item.
  - image: An optional image 
- Product: Represents a product available for sale. Key attributes include:
  - category: Links the product to a specific category using a foreign key.
  - name: The name of the product.
  - featured_image: An optional image associated with the product, uploaded using Cloudinary.
  - description: Details about the product; this can be blank or null if no description is provided.
  - image: An additional optional image for the product, also uploaded using Cloudinary.
  - price: The cost of the product.
  - is_sold: A boolean indicating whether the product has been sold.
  - created_at: Automatically set to the current date and time when the product is created.
  - created_by: Links the product to the user who created it using a foreign key.

- Relationships
   - User to Product: This is a one-to-many relationship. A user can create multiple products, but each product is associated with one user.

   - Category to Product: This is a one-to-many relationship. A category can have multiple products, but each product belongs to one category.
   Product to Category: one-to-many . Each product is linked to one category via the category foreign key. A single category can have multiple products associated with it. This relationship helps organize products, allowing users to filter and browse items by category. The related_name='products' allows for easy access to all products in a specific category.
  
   - Product to User: one-to-many relathionship. Each product is associated with one user through the created_by foreign key. A user can create multiple products, but each product belongs to a single user. This relationship enables users to manage their own products. The related_name='products' allows access to all products created by a specific user.


- Benefits of This Structure
  - Organization: The relationships and unique constraints create a well-structured database. This organization allows for efficient querying and management of products.

  - Data Integrity: The unique constraint prevents duplicates, ensuring that the product catalog remains clear and easy to navigate.
  The foreign key relationships ensure that the database remains consistent, as deleting a category or user also cleans up associated products.

  - User Management: Linking products to users allows for personalized experiences where users can manage their own products and view their inventory.

  - Foreign Key Constraints:

Description: The foreign keys (category and created_by) ensure that each product must be associated with a valid category and user. If a category or user is deleted, all associated products will also be deleted due to on_delete=models.CASCADE. This maintains referential integrity in the database. Ensures that a product cannot exist without a valid category and creator, preventing orphaned records.

The Product model effectively manages relationships and constraints to ensure data integrity and usability within the application. By linking products to categories and users, it provides a structured way to handle inventory while maintaining referential integrity.

Each User Story was linked to a 'parent' Epic issue, illustrating how they contribute to the project's overarching objectives. Acceptance criteria were rigorously tested as each story progressed to the 'Done' column, and they were also included in the comprehensive manual testing outlined in the Testing section of this README.
You can access the Epic, User Stories, and Kanban board here: [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/Esty-8/projects/9)

### Testing

- HTML Validation

Since this project utilizes Django templates, the HTML has been validated by manually executing the application pages, copying the source of the rendered pages, and then validating this version of the HTML using the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org). The HTML for the Django admin site pages was not edited, so it has not been validated here. The Signup/Registration form, Login, and Logout pages from Django Allauth were remodeled and have been validated, with results provided below.There were a few  issues encountered during the validatotion process which didn't resulted in the code not fully validated.
